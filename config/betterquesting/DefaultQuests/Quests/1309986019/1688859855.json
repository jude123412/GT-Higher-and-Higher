      "desc:8": "Polyethylene is a useful Plastic. Being the first plastic you can make its not to difficult to produce and since you have Heavy Fuel from Oilsands making this should be easy.\n\nThere are quite a few recipes to produce Ethylene but the easiest one you can do, Unless you obtain oil from some other means is to send the Heavy Fuel in a Chemical Reactor with some steam on circuit 3, This will result in Severly Steam-Cracked Heavy Fuel.\n\nNext Send the Severly Steam-Cracked Heavy Fuel through a Chemical Reactor with Circuit 10 to produce Ethylene. Now that wasn\u0027t to hard was it?\n\nSending Ethylene Through a Chemical Reactor With some Oxygen or Air Produces Polyethylene!",
