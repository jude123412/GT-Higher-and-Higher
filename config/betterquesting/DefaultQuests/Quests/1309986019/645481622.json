      "desc:8": "Gallium is a extremly important metal. This one is used for lots of electrical components, so kinda important.\n\nTo obtain Gallium there are a couple of ways to obtain it this early.\n§6\nThe first way is to electrolyse Sphalerite Dust to obtain it at a 5 percent chance. \nSphalerite comes from the Nether!\n§a\nA slightly better way to produce some is to use the Coal Slurry route. \nSimply mix Crushed Coal in a mixer with some Aqua Regia to prodruce Coal Slurry then centrifuge it!\nYes the gallium has a 2% chance this route 3% less than Sphalerite but Coal is way more easier to obtain!",
